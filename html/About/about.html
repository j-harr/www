        <h1>About jacobOL</h1>
        <h3>Biking</h3>
        <p>I grew up in a family that appreciated bike rides on regional trail
            systems. I have a Trek commuter bike. I enjoy long bikes rides especially
            on early spring or late fall days. I haven't ridden much recently because
            of my busy schedule.
        </p>
        <h3>Driving</h3>
        <p>I love to drive my car. I learned to drive on a manual and I have always
            felt like driving a manual is therapeutic and I appreciate that it takes
            my mind off of things and helps me to relax. I have gone on many long 
            spontaneous road trips, like to Denver for instance. To save money, I avoid hotels
            and sleep at rest stops if I need to.
        </p>
        <h3>Crocheting</h3>
        <p>I enjoy crocheting. It is a skill my grandmother taught me when I was
            younger and I think it is relaxing and rewarding to be able to see a project
            take shape and eventually reach completion.
        </p>
        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>Music plays an active part in my everyday life. I am rarely not listening
            to music and when I am in silence, I consider that music in and of itself.
