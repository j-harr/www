                <h3 style="text-align: center">Biking</h3>
                <p>I grew up in a family that appreciated bike rides on regional trail
                systems. I have a Trek  bike. I enjoy long bikes rides especially
                in early spring or late fall. I haven't ridden much recently because
                of my busy schedule.

                <h3>Driving</h3>
                <p>I love to drive my car. I learned to drive on a manual, and I have always
                felt like driving a manual is therapeutic. I appreciate that it takes
                my mind off of things and helps me to relax. I have gone on many long 
                spontaneous road trips, like to Denver for instance. To save money, I avoid hotels
                and sleep at rest stops if I need to.

                <h3>Crocheting</h3>
                <p>I enjoy crocheting. It is a skill my grandmother taught me when I was
                younger, and I think it is relaxing and rewarding to be able to see a project
                take shape and eventually reach completion.

                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p>Music plays an active part in my everyday life. I am rarely not listening
                to music, and when I am in silence, I consider that music in and of itself.
                I played the trombone and tuba throughout high school. It was nice getting
                 to play whole, half, and quarter notes and worry about my tone instead of 
                 worrying about hitting all of the notes.

                <h3>Horticulture</h3>
                <p>I'm no plant expert, but I do enjoy plants, flowers, and trees. I can identity 
                a healthy number of trees, and I have a plant of my own that I have been caring for 
                for several years. My favorite types of flowers are the fragant ones that bloom 
                in the evening. Moonflowers come to mind.

                <h3>Gophers</h3>
                <p>Since 2015, I have lived among gophers. I named my first groundhog
                George because he was a solitary fellow. This led me to assume he was a male.
                George also starts with a G. I understand that isn't an overly deep reason
                for that name and I apologize. The house I recently moved into has another
                groundhog. I do not know the gender of the groundhog, and I will likely not
                be able to know until the month of February. Because of this, I have named
                he/she February - Febbie or Feb for short. I have a feeling that February is
                a female, and hopefully I can confirm this in February of 2018.
